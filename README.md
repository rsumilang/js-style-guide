# JavaScript Style Guide

This JavaScript style guide is based off best practices, what's popular, and
sprinkled with a bit of personal preference. The goal of this project is to
help keep code uniformity amongst projects and team members.

You will find  a *.jshintrc*, *.eslintrc* and *.jcsrc* file in this repo that
can be used with your IDE's and/or linting tools.

## Usage

Find the relative setup **.md** file for your IDE in the [docs](docs/) folder
and follow the instructions. Configurations can also be used by CLI tools.

Please submit additional IDE setup files by forking and making a pull request.

## Guides

Please see the [guides](guides/) folder detailed documentation. Each file links
to a related example file in [examples](examples/) directory.

## Exceptions

If working on a project where a style guide is already defined, then use that
to keep code consistent. Do not change their style guide before discussing with
project owner and/or team. In the event no style rule is defined for a specific
feature, then apply the common style guide that you use among other projects.
